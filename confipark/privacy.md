# Privacy Policy – ConfiPark

**Last updated:** 9 February 2026

ConfiPark ("the app") is a mobile application that helps you save your parking location using a photo, optional GPS, and an optional note. This policy explains how the app handles your information.

## Data We Collect and How It Is Used

The app uses the following data **only on your device**:

| Data | Purpose | Stored where |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Photo** | Picture of your parking spot, taken by you in the app | On your device only |
| **Location** (optional) | GPS coordinates when you save a spot, used to show your spot on a map and to open navigation | On your device only |
| **Note** (optional) | Text you enter when saving a spot | On your device only |
| **Timestamp** | When you saved the spot | On your device only |

- **No account is required.** There is no sign-in and no user account.
- **No backend.** We do not send your photo, location, note, or timestamp to our own servers. Everything is stored locally on your phone or tablet.
- **No analytics or tracking.** The app does not collect usage analytics, advertising identifiers, or other tracking data for the developer.

## Third-Party Services

- **Map image (optional):** If you save a spot with location and the app has been configured with a map API key, the app may send the coordinates (latitude and longitude) to **Google's Static Maps API** to generate a static map image. That image is then saved on your device. Google's use of data is governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **Navigation:** When you tap "Navigate," the app opens your device's map app (e.g. Google Maps) with the saved coordinates. Use of those apps is subject to their respective privacy policies.

We do not sell or share your data with any other third parties.

---

## Data Retention and Deletion

- All saved data (photo, location, note, map image) is stored **only on your device**.
- When you use **"Delete Spot"** in the app, the stored spot and associated photo and map image files are removed from your device.
- Uninstalling the app will remove all app data from your device.

---

## Permissions

The app may request:

- **Camera** – To take a photo of your parking spot. Photos are stored only on your device.
- **Location** – To save your parking coordinates and show a map image. You can skip location; the app will still save your photo and note.

You can revoke these permissions in your device settings at any time.

## Children's Privacy

The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. All data is stored locally and not transmitted to us.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will be revised when changes are made. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
